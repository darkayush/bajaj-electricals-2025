                    The year was 1926, nearly a century ago, when a vision gradually
                    began to take shape-one that saw the potential of businesses not just
                    in terms of profits but in purpose.

                <p>
                    Shri Jamnalal Bajaj, guided by the ideals of integrity, nation-building and shared prosperity, laid the
                    foundation of what we now know as the Bajaj Group. His belief was simple yet profound-that business
                    success must go hand in hand with the greater good of society.
