                    Stakeholder engagement is central to our decision-making and business
                    strategy. We value our stakeholders as key partners in our pursuit of
                    sustainable growth and enduring value creation. Through transparent and
                    proactive communication, we continuously engage with a broad spectrum
                    of stakeholders to understand their expectations, address their concerns and
                    incorporate their insights into our operations. This collaborative approach
                    ensures that our business and ESG initiatives are aligned with stakeholder
                    priorities, enabling us to respond effectively to evolving needs and
                    foster long-term trust.
