                    <p className='text-xl'>I am pleased to present
                        the Integrated Annual
                        Report for FY 2025. This
                        has been a year that
                        tested our resilience, not
                        only through external
                        market dynamics
                        but also through
                        internal transitions.
                        As we navigated
                        key management
                        changes, we reaffirmed
                        our commitment to

                        and customer trust.

                        During the year, we experienced
                        changes in our leadership team. Mr
                        Anuj Poddar, Managing Director
                        and Chief Executive Officer and Mr

                        Officer – Consumer Products, both
                        left the Company to pursue external
                        opportunities. We turned a new
                        chapter in our leadership with the
                        appointment of Mr Sanjay Sachdeva as
                        Managing Director and Chief Executive
                        Officer. Mr. Sachdeva, formerly of
                        Unilever, brings with him invaluable
                        global experience that will help us
                        accelerate our growth in India and
                        expand our international footprint. Mr

                        Chief Operating Officer – Consumer
                        Products, bringing fresh perspective
                        and renewed energy. Together, under

                        The year 2024–25 was marked
                        by significant global disruptions,
                        including geopolitical conflicts,
                        military escalations and uncertain
                        trade dynamics affecting global supply
                        chains. Despite these headwinds,
                        India’s GDP is estimated to have grown
                        by 6.5%, primarily driven by strong
                        performance in agriculture and services,
                        coupled with rising consumption and
                        exports. Consumer preferences are
                        shifting towards premium and smart
                        products, supported by growing
                        demand for home ownership. While
                        rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India
                        have provided some relief, uncertainties
                        such as US tariffs, geopolitical tensions
                        and supply chain realignments,
                        continue to pose risks. These macro
                        trends were also reflected in our
                        business performance during the year.
                        However, it was a stronger operational
                        year for the Company.
                    </p>
                    <p className='mb-2'>
                        Our revenue from operations rose to
                        H4,828 crores, marking a 4% year-onyear increase. We gained momentum
                        in the second half of the year, with
                        revenues growing by 5.7% as compared
                        to 2.2% in the first half. We reported a
                        Profit Before Tax (PBT) of H170 crores
                        this year, slightly less than H173 crores
                        last year. Nevertheless, adjusting for
                        one-time gains of H41 crores from
                        income tax refunds in the previous year
                        and H21 crores of exceptional gains this
                        year, our underlying PBT grew to H148
                        crores from H132 crores, registering
                        a healthy 12.4% increase. This
                        underscores the fundamental strength
                        of our operations.

                        The Consumer Products business faced
                        demand fluctuations, yet key segments
                        demonstrated notable resilience.
                        Products from the Morphy Richards
                        brand and domestic appliances such
                        as air coolers recorded strong growth.
                        This was further supported by broadbased channel growth across trade,
                        e-commerce and modern format
                        retail. The premium segment in select
                        domestic and kitchen appliance
                        categories also grew, mirroring
                        evolving customer aspirations. I am
                        confident that increasing disposable
                        income, shifting consumption patterns,
                        easing inflation and RBI rate cuts
                        will accelerate the positive growth
                        trajectory of this business.
