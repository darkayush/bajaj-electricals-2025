                    Materiality assessment forms the foundation of our sustainability approach.
                    This enables us to prioritise the most relevant issues, engage meaningfully with
                    stakeholders and strengthen our commitment to transparency and accountability.
                    By embedding materiality into our decision-making processes, we are equipped
                    to manage risks, encourage innovation and generate shared value.

                <p>
                    This involves active engagement with stakeholders such as employees, senior
                    management, Board of directors, customers, suppliers, regulatory bodies,
                    NGOs and community representatives to identify environmental, social and
                    governance (ESG) issues that are most relevant. Their input helps ensure that
                    the issues considered reflect both societal expectations and emerging external
                    trends that may impact the business.

                        The materiality
                        assessment is
                        systematically
                        integrated into the
                        Company’s Enterprise
                        Risk Management
                        (ERM) process. This
                        ensures that identified
                        ESG issues are not
                        evaluated in isolation
                        but are aligned with the
                        organisation’s broader
                        risk and opportunity
                        landscape. The result is
                        a more strategic and riskinformed view of ESG
                        priorities.

                        Once ESG issues are

                        potential impact on
                        business performance.
                        These are plotted on a
